# Leap Motion Demo

This repo contains javascript demo projects for [leap motion](http://www.leapmotion.com). To run the projects, open the index.htm of each project. You will need the Leap motion device to run the demos.

## Particles

Particles is derived from Mike Bostock's [particles](https://gist.github.com/1062544) demo. A stream of particles should follow your fingers as they move.

## Gestures

Gestures attempts to recognise shapes that your fingers draw. Gesture recognition is provided using the [$1 unistroke recognizer](http://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/dollar/) from the University of Washington.

Currently, you should start from a fist. It'll start recognizing when you have one finger drawing. It'll stop when your finger becomes a fist.
